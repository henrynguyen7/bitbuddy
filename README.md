This web2py project uses the following libraries:

- bitcoind: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
- bitcoinrpc: https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc

INSTALLATION:
1) Install web2py: http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download. It is recommended to install from source as the Mac OS X client has errors on startup.
2) Clone this project into the web2py/applications/ folder. The name given to the folder will be the name of the web2py project, meaning all request URLs will include that name. It is therefore recommended to keep this name simple, e.g. "bitbuddy".
